# remove_too_much_fileds_from_songs
Remove the fields that are too much in the propresenter song files

when using propresenter over time, there could be too much fields added to the song files,
this can happen when applying different templates to the song files.

it looks like this only happens on Windows platforms.

this python script can remove them to speed up propresenter, and prevent some side effects like flikkering on the output.
